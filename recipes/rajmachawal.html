    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rajma chawal is a popular dish in Indian cuisine that consists of kidney beans cooked in a tomato and onion-based gravy, served with steamed rice. It is a staple in many households and is enjoyed for its hearty and comforting flavors. The dish is often seasoned with a blend of aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, and garam masala, which gives it a rich and flavorful taste. Rajma chawal is also a nutritious meal, as kidney beans are a good source of protein and fiber, while rice provides carbohydrates. It is a filling and satisfying dish that can be enjoyed for lunch or dinner, and is often paired with a side of pickles, yogurt, or papadums.</p>

        <li>1 tsp garam masala powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp red chili powder (optional)</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 inch ginger, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup basmati rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water (for cooking rice)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ghee (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves, finely chopped (for garnishing)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Soak 1 cup of rajma (kidney beans) in water overnight or for at least 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Drain the water from the soaked rajma and rinse them well.</li>
        <li>In a pressure cooker, heat 2 tbsp of oil and add 1 tsp cumin seeds.</li>
        <li>When the cumin seeds start to splutter, add 1 finely chopped onion and sauté until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add 2-3 cloves of chopped garlic and 1 inch of chopped ginger. Sauté for a minute.</li>
        <li>Add 2 finely chopped tomatoes and sauté until they turn mushy.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp coriander powder, 1 tsp garam masala powder, 1 tsp turmeric powder, and 1 tsp red chili powder (optional). Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked and rinsed rajma to the cooker along with 3 cups of water and salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Pressure cook the rajma for about 10-12 whistles or until they are soft and fully cooked.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, wash 1 cup of basmati rice and add 2 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Cook the rice until it is fully cooked and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Once the rajma is fully cooked, open the cooker and check if the gravy has a medium consistency. If it's too thin, simmer it for a few more minutes until it thickens.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and add 1 tbsp of ghee (optional) to the rajma and mix well.</li>
        <li>Serve the rajma hot with the steamed rice and garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves.</li>
      </ol>
