    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Handi paneer is a popular North Indian dish made with paneer (cottage cheese) cooked in a rich and creamy tomato-based gravy. The dish is usually prepared in a handi, a traditional Indian cooking vessel that adds an earthy flavor to the dish. The paneer is first marinated with spices and yogurt, then cooked in the handi along with onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and a blend of aromatic spices such as garam masala, cumin, coriander, and turmeric. Finally, a generous amount of cream is added to give the dish a smooth and velvety texture. Handi paneer is best served with hot naan bread or steamed rice, and garnished with fresh coriander leaves. It is a flavorful and satisfying vegetarian dish that is loved by many.</p>
